These configurations are for the EAP 6. Maybe some version numbers need to be modified to make it work on a JBoss AS 7.1 (at least version 7.1.2 recommended).

There are already some port-offsets configured into the servers:
- live1   has 0
- backup1 has 25
- live2   has 100
- backup1 has 125

Also on every server there already is a user "admin" with password "123123" as both: ApplicationUser and ManagementUser.

Copy the standalone/configuration/ directories into you servers and start them as follows:
live1  : ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=jl1
backup1: ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=jbu1
live2  : ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=jl2
backup2: ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=jbu2
